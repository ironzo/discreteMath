    "# Diagonal Puzzle: Non-Intersecting Diagonals\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "**Draw 16 diagonals that do not touch each other on a 5×5 grid**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "This is a classic constraint satisfaction problem in discrete mathematics. The challenge is to place the maximum number of diagonals in a grid such that no two diagonals share a common vertex (intersection point).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Approach\n",
    "- **Algorithm**: Backtracking with constraint checking\n",
    "- **Key Insight**: A 5×5 grid has a 6×6 grid of vertices. Each diagonal uses exactly 2 vertices.\n",
    "- **Constraint**: Two diagonals cannot share the same vertex\n",
    "- **Search Space**: For each cell, we try 3 options: empty, '/' diagonal, or '\\\\' diagonal\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topics Covered\n",
    "- Backtracking algorithms\n",
    "- Constraint satisfaction problems\n",
    "- Combinatorial optimization\n",
    "- Recursive problem solving"
