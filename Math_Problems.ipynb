    "\n",
    "Suppose there is a sequence of 20 cells, the first cell contains number 1 and the last cell contains 50. We would like to fill all cells with integer numbers in such a way that numbers in the neighbouring cells differ by at most k. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** For which minimal k is this possible?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key observations:**\n",
    "- We have 20 cells total\n",
    "- First cell: 1, Last cell: 50\n",
    "- Number of \"gaps\" between cells: 19 (between 20 cells)\n",
    "- Total difference to cover: 50 - 1 = 49\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical reasoning:**\n",
    "- If neighboring cells differ by at most k, we can increase by at most k in each step\n",
    "- To go from 1 to 50 in 19 steps, we need: $k \\geq \\lceil \\frac{49}{19} \\rceil = \\lceil 2.58 \\rceil = 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** The minimal k is **3**. "
